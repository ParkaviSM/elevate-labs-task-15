📊 Machine Learning Project
📌 Overview

This project focuses on data analysis and machine learning using a dataset (train.csv). The main objective is to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build a predictive model, and evaluate its performance.

The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook (task_15.ipynb) using Python and popular data science libraries.

📊 Dataset

The dataset (train.csv) contains structured data used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

Steps performed:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling (if applied)

Splitting data into training and testing sets
